# What We're All About

We're in our **seventh semester** of offering seminars on using `R` for data science. 

</br>

We were founded in **2015** by Christy Garcia, Chris Prener, and Kelly Lovejoy.

</br>

We are a **collaborative, interdisciplinary** group at Saint Louis University focused on **building community** around open source software and open science.

---

# What We're All About

We `r emojifont::emoji('heart')` `R`, RStudio, and the `tidyverse`!

--

</br>

Our seminars cover *most* of data science workflow from Wickham and Grollman (2016):

```{r add-workflow-image, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/workflow.png")
```

# GitHub

We host all of our materials on GitHub. If you want to get back to the lesson materials later, head to [https://github.com/slu-dss](https://github.com/slu-dss) and look for the `wrangling-01` repository (a special type of folder).

```{r add-github-image, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/github.png")
```

# Getting Started

* You need to have `R` installed and **RStudio** open.

* You need to have installed all of the necessary packages:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "knitr", "janitor", 
"rmarkdown", "usethis"))
```

* You need to have downloaded and opened our lesson materials:

```r
usethis::use_course(
"https://github.com/slu-dss/wrangling-01/archive/master.zip")
```

* RStudio should open a new window that says `wrangling-01` in the upper right hand corner.

# Data Wrangling Verbs

* *rename* - change variable names
* *select* - subset columns
* *mutate* - modify values
* *arrange* - sort data based on values
* *filter* - subset based on values
* *summarize* - create grouped summaries of data

These are all implemented in the tidyverse package `dplyr`, which we'll be focusing on with this seminar series.
