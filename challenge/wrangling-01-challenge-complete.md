Data Wrangling in R, Lesson 1 Challenge Solution
================
(January 23, 2019)

## Introduction

This is the challenge notebook for the first data wrangling lesson. Test
the skills that you picked up today by cleaning hurricane data from
`dplyr`. Weâ€™ve filled in the dependencies section - the rest is up to
you\!

## Dependencies

This notebook requires two packages from the `tidyverse` as well as two
additional packages:

``` r
# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr)     # data wrangling
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(readr)     # read and write csv files

# data wrangling
library(janitor)   # data wrangling

# manage file paths
library(here)      # manage file paths
```

## Cleaning Data

In a single pipeline, you should:

1.  Read the data from `data/storms_messy.csv` into `R`
2.  Clean all of the very messy variable names
3.  Remove the latitude and longitude variables altoghether
4.  Further clean up the names of the storm name (there is a typo\!),
    saffir simpson category, status, wind, and pressure variables

<!-- end list -->

``` r
read_csv(here("data", "storms_messy.csv")) %>%
  clean_names(case = "lower_camel") %>%
  select(-latitudeLocationOfStormCenter, -longitudeLocationOfStormCenter) %>%
  rename(
    name = stromName,
    status = stormsStatus,
    cat = saffirSimpsonStormCategoryNumber,
    winds = windSpeedKnots,
    pressure = pressureMillibars
  ) -> stormsClean
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `strom name` = col_character(),
    ##   `READING YEAR` = col_double(),
    ##   `READING MONTH` = col_double(),
    ##   `READING DAY` = col_double(),
    ##   `READING HOUR` = col_double(),
    ##   `latitude, _location of storm center` = col_double(),
    ##   `longitude, _location of storm center` = col_double(),
    ##   `storm's status` = col_character(),
    ##   `_Saffir-Simpson storm category #` = col_double(),
    ##   `wind speed (knots)` = col_double(),
    ##   `pressure (_millibars)` = col_double()
    ## )
